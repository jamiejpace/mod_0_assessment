# When I initially completed my hashes, I made an error with git and could not get my changes to push to my GitHub. I wasn't sure what was wrong, so I tried to initialize git inside the models file, which was a mistake, because then I had initialized git twice in the mod_0_assessment directory. From there I wasn't sure how to fix it, so I ended up deleting the whole thing and starting again, although I saved the content of my variable and model files so I wouldn't have to re-write the code. So, I'm writing this to say that my commits do not accurately reflect the time I spent on this section. I was originally finished in about 50 minutes when I ran into the problem, and once I deleted and then recreated it, it took me another 15 minutes. In total it toook me about an hour and five minutes.
